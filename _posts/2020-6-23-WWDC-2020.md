WWDC 2020
Yesterday, June 22, 2020, Apple hosted WWDC 20. It opened with Tim Cook in Steve Jobs Theatre with an empty audience,
Tim Cook addresseed racism and COVID-19. Then they went into iOS 14. iOS 14 has some new features like some new features for the home screen,
for phone calls, a redesigned Siri, new widgets and features, something new called the App Library, and much much more! They introduced some new features in
iPadOS, tvOS, macOS (Big Sur), and watchOS 7.


iOS 14

Apple in iOS 13 addressed the annoying volume and silent pop up making it so it doesn't take up the entire screen, now a small pop up on the left side or on the top of the screen pops up, however they did not make changes to phone calls or Siri. They finally dealt with that in iOS 14.

The also made it so finding apps is a lot easier, they introduced the App Library, here you can put pages of apps that you would maybe neglect. So instead of having thousands of pages, you can have a few, and have the App Library! You can search for your apps, visit your suggested apps, view certain apps much faster while your phone is much more organized!

Another new feature in iOS 14 is the widgets on the main home pages, you can customize them! You can make them different sizes and where you want them on the home page! You can also keep them where they were before. There is this new widget that shows you multiple widgets throughout the day. It changes and shows you what it thinks you may want or need.

Siri got a well deserved change! Siri now does not take up the whole screen and is much smaller and more enjoyable to use, at least in my opinion she is!

The messages app got a bunch of great new features including mentions, group chat photos, reply to certain texts in group chats, and pin certain people or groups your texting and they will show up at the top of the app!
Overall iOS 14 did pretty good, iOS 13 and 14 have brought well needed changes to the operating system. Now it's here! Developers beta is out now, public beta will be released in July 2020 and it will be released to the public in the Fall of 2020 along side the new iPhone lineup!




iPadOS
iPadOS is a game changer! 
![iPadOS](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIF.8JicW8zdNmrRYrthoFY7Xg%26pid%3DApi&f=1)
I currently don't have any pictures, but it is amazing and is being out the capabilities of the iPad. It is more fit for the iPad and makes the device really shine. It makes it more and more like a laptop and is making it a harder decision between a MacBook Air or an iPad Pro. Overall the future of the iPad looks very promising! It could have a potato one day maybe become better than a MacBook or another PC laptop. 
It brings all new and well needed features for the Apple Pencil when drawing, you can now select certain words and move them around, you can spell using your Apple Pencil in the search bar of safari now and you can do so much more. 
iPadOS brings better multitasking and more customized OS for iPad!


##MacOS
Apple made a revolutionary day with the MacBook today. With releasing Apple Silicone!

It's making the MacBook more Apple. It will be much better than the current Intel Chip.
They also released a new OS for Mac, Big Sur.
![Big Sur](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIF.MbGnPpUx4cSibc0dRT5%252blQ%26pid%3DApi&f=1)
This is reinventing macOS making it more like iOS and iPadOS applications and giving it more features to work better in the Apple ecosystem. 
This overall is major for Mac. 



##watchOS 7
watchOS 7 is big for Apple Watch, it adds better customization to the Apple Watch screen. So now we can customize it to our own fit which is awesome! 
It also now has a new sleep feature! It will help you get better rest, and understand your sleeping and sleep schedule. It also has more workouts, including dancing!
