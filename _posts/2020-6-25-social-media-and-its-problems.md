Social media’s are amazing, they let you share images, videos, texts, and more across the world in a matter of milliseconds. They allow you to stay in contact with your friends, family, and maybe even coworkers or schoolmates. 

Social Media can be a great place and can have a lot of benefits, but the thing you don’t see, the things the companies don’t bring out or market is the bad side of it. The problems with it.

No I’m not talking about technical issues like with their servers, I’m talking about the effect it has on you. That’s one of the many problems it has. Influencers, rich folks, famous people and even the everyday person makes social media look amazing, but they are also adding so many problems to it. 

These include things like Jealousy, cyber bullying, and materialism along with more. We are gonna talk about these 3 things in this article, some of you will refuse to accept the fact that social media does this, and others will agree with what I’m about to see. 



## Jealousy
This is one of the biggest problems with social media, yet we don’t see it or know it effects us. You see most people on social media like to post the highlights of their life, and there is nothing wrong with that. Weather it is a vacation, a get together, or something else, and when we see these a lot of these posts over and over, it can take a toll on you and change your thinking. 


It changes your thinking by making you think that everyone has a perfect life, no issues, and they have no burdens or problems. This right here is the biggest problem with social media in my opinion. It effects the young, the old, men and female. No matter who you are, social media will eventually make you think like this. 

Let’s say you follow 100 people. That is 100 different people who will post the highlights of their life. A lot of people will even fake it to look like they have an amazing life. I know quite a bit of people who do this. 
Now when you see everyone posting their highlights of their life you can develop the attitude that everyone’s life is better. 


You will begin to think, well Tommy and his Wife are always traveling and Jim and his wife Ashley and their kids are always doing fun family activities and Jennifer’s kid is always doing well in school, but in reality Tommy and his Wife travel 2 times a year but post the photos and later do a “throw back Thursday” and post it again making you think they do a lot more than what they actually do. Then Jim and his wife Ashley and their kids may appear they are a happy family and are always doing stuff together, but in reality Jim and Ashley are having marital issues but they hide it so no one suspects anything. Then Jennifer’s kid who is always doing well in let’s say Math, he may suck at everything else but they only post him doing good. Then you follow 100 accounts of this. It will change the way you think. It makes you think everyone has it perfect or better than you, but you don’t see what they don’t post, what’s behind the photos. 

Don’t think that everyone has it perfect because they don’t. Everyone has problems that arise and issues, but one one posts that, they want to look like a perfect family. This is one of the biggest problem with social media in my opinion. 


## Cyber Bullying 
Now we move on to another massive issue with social media... cyber bullying. This one can effect anyone. Anyone can be the victim to this. The problem with cyber bullying is the fact that some one is sitting behind a screen talking trash to you who doesn’t have the balls to do it to your face. 


It can also be some middle aged man who weighs 500 lbs who is sitting in the dark basement of his moms house who isn’t happy with the way his life turned out, so he is bullying others. People can do almost anything online. They can use it for good or for bad, and there are plenty of people who use it for bad. Some people just like to see others suffer and hurt so they will bully them. Why they do this? I don’t know, but this is a major problem with it. People will hurt you and kick you down on purpose just so they can look “cool”, feel better about themselves, or for one of their many other reasons they do it. 



## Materialism 
Now the final topic we are going to consider is materialism. If you follow and company on a social media, you are effected by this problem. Weather you see it or not is another problem but we won’t get into that now. Major companies like to use social media to market. It’s a major platform and an easy way to reach users. 

Companies will post over and over saying you have to have their product to be liked or to be happy and that just ain’t true. They say this and we begin to think it’s true and we feel we have to have their product to be happy, therefore developing a problem of materialism. 

Or, we may follow someone who every year get the newest smartphone every year when it’s released. Then we begin to think that person is always happy and always has the newest electronics. Then we begin to think that we have to have it to be happy. Or maybe you follow a celebrity and they post a photo in front of their Lamborghini parked in front of their million dollar beach house. Then we may want that too. Then we may start to buy a bigger house, a nicer car, or more stuff and then we develop a materialistic attitude. 



Social media has a lot of pros, but also a lot of major cons. If you are considering getting social media, remember these and remember I only touched the surface of the problems. I don’t care if you have social media or not, just in my opinion the issues need to be brought to the attention of people because most people are blind to the problems. I have some social media’s, but I try to remember that there is much more to these peoples lives, I try to block the haters, and if I find myself developing a materialistic attitude I will unfollow that account or take a break from social media. If any of these issues become to big for me or begin to become a problem I will take a break from social media or if it gets bad enough, delete the account.
