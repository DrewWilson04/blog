## Finger on the app!
MSCHF and MrBeast have teamed up and made an app called Finger on the app and they are awarding up to $25,000 for the winner.


### What do you have to do?
Starting June 30, 2020 at 15:00 EST you will have to place your finger on the designated area on your iPhone. You have to keep your finger in the designated area, sounds pretty easy, right? However, random circles with a 5 second timer inside of it, you must touch the circle before the 5 seconds is over. 


### What's the prize?
The winner can win anywhere from 1 cent up to $25,000. Everyone that loses gets to choose an amount from 1 cent up to $25,000 and the winner wil get the averged votes for prize.


### How long is the challenge? 
There is no set time, it Starts June 30, at 15:00 EST but the end of the challenge is until the very last person takes their finger off the designated area or doesn't pop the last bubble. This means that the challenge could go for a few seconds up to years. 


### How many people will play? 
There is expected to be over 3,900 people who play, this numer is very likely higher, but we dont know, I can only confirm 3,900 people. 


### Is it fair?
Not exactly, the fact that the losers of the challenge will choose the amount you get, if everyone is salty you may get a lot less than $25k, but who knows the internet can be nice sometimes.... Another issue would be with bots, it would be very hard for the average everyday person to code and build a bot/robot to do this. However, it's not impossible. So a robot vs a human, a robot would win easy. Due to the fact that humans need sleep, a robot doesn't, then it would win easy. Earlier in the article I said it could go on for years, this would only be possible if 2 or more people make bots and neither bot stops, then this challenge could very possibly go on for years. There has been talk about updating the app so it will detect bots and make them lose or end the game for them. 


If you decide to play, good luck and I hope you win! If you do lose though, don't be a jerk and make it 1 cent, be kind and make it a fair amount, but good luck!
